# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-DDD-using-Deep-Learning
This project detects driver drowsiness by analyzing eye and facial states through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ResNet50V2 transfer learning model. With 99% accuracy, it integrates with OpenCV for real-time monitoring and triggers an audio alert if drowsiness is detected.
