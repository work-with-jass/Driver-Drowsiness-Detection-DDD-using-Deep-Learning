# Driver Drowsiness Detection (DDD) using Deep Learning


This project detects driver drowsiness by analyzing eye and facial states through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ResNet50V2 transfer learning model. With 99% accuracy, it integrates with OpenCV for real-time monitoring and triggers an audio alert if drowsiness is detected.

A real-time drowsiness detection system designed to enhance road safety using Deep Learning! This project was a collaborative effort by our incredible team: Jasleen Kaur, Jingxiu Yin, Sulaimon Aderoju, and Zachary Wong, under the guidance of our instructor, Baha Rababah, at RRC Polytech.

## 💡 Challenges We Overcame

Building a real-time AI-powered detection system came with multiple challenges:

🔹 Handling Large Datasets – Our dataset was too large for Google Colab, causing crashes. We solved this by setting up a local Docker environment for training.

🔹 Overfitting & Underfitting – Balancing model performance was crucial. We improved accuracy by fine-tuning CNN layers and implementing data augmentation.

🔹 Real-Time Deployment – Jupyter Notebooks weren’t ideal for webcam integration, so we developed a standalone Python script to efficiently process video frames.


## 🎯 Future Enhancements

🔹 Improved Real-Time Detection – Incorporating additional fatigue indicators like blink frequency, yawning detection, and head movement.

🔹 Optimizing Model Speed – Reducing inference time for smoother detection.

🔹 Mobile & Automotive Deployment – Exploring integration into mobile apps and in-car systems.

🔹 User-Friendly Interface – Creating an intuitive UI for easier interaction and visualization.


This project has been a significant milestone in my academic journey, equipping me with practical skills in AI, deep learning, and real-time system deployment.

Let’s innovate for a safer tomorrow! 🚦✨
